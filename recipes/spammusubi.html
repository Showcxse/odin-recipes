        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Spam Musubi is a type of sushi that features marinated spam. It is a popular snack throughout all 
        the Hawaiian islands, which can be eaten at home or on the go. </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) container fully cooked spam</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.</li>
            <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. 
            Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Stir together sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a medium bowl 
            until sugar is completely dissolved. Slice luncheon meat lengthwise 
            into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook slices until lightly browned, 
            about 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface. Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, 
            and press rice tightly inside. Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press. Wrap nori around rice, 
            sealing edges with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices 
            and about 1-inch thick.)</li>
            <li>Serve musubi warm or chilled.</li>
        </ol>
